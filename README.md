# Making-things-see
I am going through Greg Borenstein's book, "Making Things See" and saving scripts here.
the book is kind of old and some of the libraries referenced either don't exist anymore or are really hard to find so I have had to modify the samples to work with processing 3. 

To use any of these scripts, plug a Microsoft Kinect into a power adapter and the power adapter into usb port on your computer. Run the program through processing.org platform.
